This is a simple counting library for simulation work.
			by Tien-Fu Chen @ 2014
			
-- you don't have to declare count variables before you use!!
-- Using count variables will remember the original condition expression
       and your source file and line #.
-- Any multiple counting calls to the same name will be merged together.
   (One name will give a unique counter, no matter where you use)
-- The final summary can give the average and variance (and non-zero count).
-- enable it by defining Arch_stat (give -DArch_stat for gcc)
      nothing happens if Arch_stat is not defined.
      
Usage:
	stat_tick(Condition, Counter name): 
			a simple counting
	stat_variable(Condition, Accumulator name, variable): 
			an accumlating function to sum up all variables
	
	stat_summary(): print out all statistic results, 
			level>0 will give more detailed info
